# Rengine
SFML based 2D game framework [WIP]

v0.1.0
***
### What is it?
Rengine is 2D video game development framework based on [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org). Currently is does not have any editor functionality, consequently, everything needs to be done by code. A tutorial will be soon added to get you started. This project was for my final year submission for Bachelor's and for a game I was working on at the time.

### Important Notice
The development of this project will be slow since I have one more year of university and a job as well. Currently, it is not suitable for any professional implementation whatsoever.

### Contribution
Though this project is one of many sharing the similar idea, it does not even compare to some of the stuff out there as of now. However, if you'd like to invest your time in helping improving this project then you're welcome to. Contact me at himan2104@gmail.com.
